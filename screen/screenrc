# When you open a text editor like nano in screen and then close it, the text may stay visible in 
# your terminal. To fix this, put the following in your ~/.screenrc:
altscreen on

# By default, screen uses an 8-color terminal emulator. Use the following line to enable more 
# colors, which is useful if you are using a more-capable terminal emulator:
term screen-256color

# Turn welcome message off. Cause it's annoying. Add to ~/.screenrc:
startup_message off

# Add the username to be used in the hardstatus later
backtick 50 0 0 echo $USER

# Turn your hardstatus line into a dynamic urxvt|xterm|aterm window title. This one's pretty
# simple; just switch your current hardstatus line into a caption line with notification, and
# edit accordingly:
backtick 1 5 5 true
termcapinfo rxvt* 'hs:ts=\E]2;:fs=\007:ds=\E]2;\007'
hardstatus string "%50`@%H: screen (%n: %t)%? [%h]%?"

# The scroll buffer of GNU Screen can be accessed with C-a [. However, this is very inconvenient. 
# To use the scroll bar of e.g. xterm or konsole, add the following line to ~/.screenrc:
termcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@

# By default, the first screen window is 0. If you'd rather never have a window 0 and start 
# instead with 1, put something like the following in your ~/.screenrc:
bind c screen 1
bind ^c screen 1
bind 0 select 10                                                            
screen 1
